# MoviesDatabase API Documentation Overview

## API Overview
CineSeek is a modern movie discovery application that utilizes the **MoviesDatabase API**. This API allows users to browse movies, view specific movie details, and search for films by criteria such as year or genre. The integration requires proper API handling and strict TypeScript typing to ensure reliability and type safety.

## APP Version
 version 0.1.0

## Available Endpoints
The application primarily interacts with the following endpoint:
*   **/titles:** This is the main endpoint used for fetching movie data. It supports filtering functionality by year and genre, and importantly, it implements pagination to manage browsing through results efficiently.

## Request and Response Format

### Request Structure
A typical request is handled via a server-side API route in the Next.js application (e.g., `pages/api/fetch-movies.ts`). This route receives parameters from the client side, such as:
*   **page:** Used for pagination.
*   **year:** Used for filtering the movie list by release year.
*   **genre:** Used for filtering the movie list by genre.

The server-side route then constructs the external API call using these parameters. For instance, a `POST` request is used to fetch the movies in the CineSeek application, sending the filter parameters in the request body.

### Response Structure
When consuming RESTful APIs with TypeScript, it is crucial to define the expected structure of the returned data. The API response data, accessed via `response.json()`, must be mapped to specific TypeScript interfaces to ensure type safety.

Key components of the expected movie data response (`MoviesProps`) include:

| Field | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `id` | `string` | Unique identifier for the movie. |
| `primaryImage.url` | `string` | The URL for the movie poster image. |
| `titleText.text` | `string` | The title of the movie. |
| `releaseYear.year` | `string` | The year the movie was released. |

## Authentication Requirements
The MoviesDatabase API uses **API key authentication**.

1.  **Method:** Authentication is carried out by passing the API key through **headers** in the HTTP request.
2.  **Security:** The API key is a sensitive credential and **must be stored in environment variables** (e.g., `MOVIE_API_KEY` in `.env.local`).
3.  **Protection:** To prevent client-side exposure of the API key, the API call is processed through a **server-side API route** within Next.js.

## Error Handling
Implementing robust error handling is crucial to ensure the application can **gracefully handle unexpected situations**.

| Technique | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Status Code Checking** | Different HTTP status codes should be handled using conditional logic. If the API response is not successful (`!response.ok`), an error must be explicitly **thrown**. |
| **Try/Catch Blocks** | Use try/catch blocks within API routes to capture and manage errors resulting from network issues or unsuccessful API responses. |
| **Loading States** | A Loading component should be utilized to manage pending states, providing necessary feedback to users while data is being fetched. |
| **Type Guards** | Type guards should be used to validate the structure of the incoming API data before consumption, aligning with best practices. |

## Usage Limits and Best Practices

### Usage Limits
Developers must be mindful of **API rate limiting** considerations enforced by the MoviesDatabase API to prevent service disruption.

### Best Practices
To ensure application efficiency and compliance:
*   **Pagination:** Use pagination to limit the request size, ensuring efficient data management and reduced load.
*   **Caching:** Consider implementing **client-side caching** of responses for frequently requested data to significantly **reduce load times and the number of API calls**.
*   **Type Safety:** Define TypeScript interfaces or types for all API response data, which helps catch errors early.
*   **Environment Variables:** Always store sensitive data, such as API keys, in environment variables rather than hardcoding them in the codebase.
*   **Asynchronous Handling:** Use `async/await` to handle asynchronous API calls, which ensures the code is clean and readable.
